    <p align="center" >I saw an alligator do a 180 pop shove it, heelflip to no comply to a double kickflip,<br> and then his mouth unhinged like a snake or alligator and there was fire and the old man said<br>"thats not my son, he's a dragon." then he pleaded if we could destroy his dragon son, So I threw a bus <br>at it and then the dragon exploded into ice. Then the village children came out thinking it was candy<br> and as soon as the box fell off the table the clock turned on it's own without batteries and I mean<br> it turned like not the hands in the face but on the nighstand it was on. But that's not a documentatry about that and that's not a documentary about this  </p>
